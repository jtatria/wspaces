Title: Construction and analysis of semantic space models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: J. T. Atria
Maintainer: J. T. Atria <jtatria@gmail.com>
Description: A package for the construction of distributional semantic models, developed with a
    focus on speed and modularity. Provides an R interface to a Lucene index for the compilation of
    distributional information, a set of standards for the construction and manipulation of lexical
    datasets, facilities for diachronic analysis across corpus partitions from provenance meta-data,
    and numerical procedures for the production of semantic network and vector space models.
    Computationally intense operations are coded in C++ using Rcpp, following a standard interface
    to allow different computing back-ends in order to take advantage of parallel computation
    (using RcppParallel) or GPU processing (using CUDA/OpenCL) where available.
    The focus on speed facilitates rapid iteration for exploratory analyses of different models'
    parameter spaces.
